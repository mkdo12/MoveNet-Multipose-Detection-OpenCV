# MultiPose Real-Time Human Pose Estimation

A real-time multi-person human pose estimation system built using **TensorFlow MoveNet Multipose (Lightning)** and **OpenCV**. This project detects and visualizes human keypoints and skeletal connections from both video files and live webcam streams with high efficiency and low latency.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time multi-person pose estimation pipeline** capable of detecting multiple humans simultaneously and rendering **17 anatomical keypoints per person**.  
The system is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-world computer vision applications.

The architecture leverages a **MobileNetV2 image feature extractor**, combined with a **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)** decoder and **CenterNet-style prediction heads**, enabling fast inference while maintaining robustness.
